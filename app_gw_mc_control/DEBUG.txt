I2C Debug
=========

scope trace from i2cdetect -y 1 shows:
rPi drives SCL low for 10us
then starts clocking with a perios of 10us. First a high pulse of 5us, then low pulse of us
10 rising edges
transmitted value: (MSB first) 0b000001101
Last bit is !ACK which is 1 which means no ACK. That makes because XMOS I2C slave isn't running.

Now starting I2C slave on XMOS:
After swapping the wires I get the XMOS device detected reliably by i2cdetect -y 1 at address 0x3C

But smbus write from Python fails:
Writing I2C devie at address 0x3c with value 0xff
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "./rpi_i2c.py", line 17, in <module>
    bus.write_byte(address, write_val);

Despite that XMOS slave sees the stop bit:
from xscope trace:
REGFILE: stop_bit

But the read works!
Read from I2C devie at address 60: data 6

XMOS:
REGFILE: select reg[1]
REGFILE: reg[1] -> 6
REGFILE: stop_bit

Analysing the write signals to se why there is no ack.
I2C analyser sees:
Address Ack 0, Data Ack 1

But for Read it's the same"
Address Ack 0, Data Ack 1

Signal level:
